Figure A: Plot of the log-posterior at each iteration of the EM
algorithm to demonstrate monotonicity and convergence

Figure B: Trace plots of the number of proteins allocated to the known
components in each of 6 parallel MCMC runs. Chain 4 is discarded
because of lack of convergence. 600 samples are retained from
remaining chains and pooled.

Figure C: Gene Ontology over representation analysis on outlier
proteins - that is proteins allocated with less than probability
0.95. We analyse the enrichment of terms in the cellular compartment,
biological process, and molecular function ontologies. We display the
top 10 significant results in the dotplots.

Figure C: A heatmap representation of a contingency table comparing
allocation produced by MCMC and MAP methods with posterior probability
threshold set at 0.99 for both methods.  The scale ranges from 0 to 1
with values indicating the proportion of assigned proteins to that
sub-cellular location. Values along the diagonal represent agreement
between classifiers whilst other values represent disagreement.  The
allocations of proteins by both methods are in strong agreement.
